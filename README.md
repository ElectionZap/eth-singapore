## Short Description
**PolyVOTE** is a cutting-edge platform for secure and private voting that leverages Multi-Party Computation (MPC), Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK), and AI-driven personalized voting recommendations to ensure privacy, prevent collusion, and enhance voter decision-making.

## Problem
Modern voting systems face significant challenges, including:
- **Collusion Resistance:** Preventing coercion or incentivized voting.
- **Blind Computation:** Keeping voter data private while computing election results securely.

## Opportunities
- **Private Computation:** Use of MPC allows sensitive vote data to remain private during computation.
- **AI Recommendations:** Voters can receive tailored recommendations based on their preferences.
- **Anti-Collusion:** Secure anti-collusion mechanisms as a service for elections.

## Our Solution
**PolyVOTE** offers a fully private and secure voting service, combining MPC, ZK proofs, and AI-driven recommendations. Voters can cast their votes with confidence, knowing their privacy is protected, and election results remain transparent yet confidential.

### Key Features:
- **Private & Secure Voting:** Voter data, vote casting, and recommendations remain completely private.
- **MPC & ZK Integration:** Ensures privacy while allowing verifiable computation.
- **AI-Powered Recommendations:** Personalized recommendations based on user profiles.
- **Anti-Collusion Mechanisms:** Protects against collusion in the voting process.
- **Privacy-Preserving Analytics:** Transparent results without revealing individual votes.

## How It Works
1. **Connect a Wallet:** Securely link your wallet to the platform.
2. **Create an Election Poll:** Generate a ZK-auditable poll using our intuitive interface.
3. **AI Recommendations:** Receive personalized voting advice based on AI analysis of election data.
4. **Cast Your Vote:** Follow the AI recommendation or vote independently.
5. **View Results:** Access election results and data through privacy-preserving analytics.

## How It Was Made
- **UI & Smart Contracts:** We provide a whitelabel UI for election poll creation, deploying *MACI contracts* on *Linea*.
- **AI Integration:** *ChatGPT* is used to generate election questions and weight scores for AI-powered voting recommendations.
- **Private Storage & Computation:** Leveraging *Nillion* for securely storing weights and performing blind computation (MPC).
- **Private Voting:** Voting is carried out privately and securely via *MACI contracts*, ensuring full privacy throughout.
